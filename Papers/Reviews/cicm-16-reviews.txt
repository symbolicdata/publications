Perspective. Some Architectural Considerations 
AUTHORS: Hans-Gert Graebe

OVERALL EVALUATION: 3 (strong accept)

----------- Review -----------

This paper describes the evolving architecture and growth of the SymbolicData
project.
* Specific improvements were made to: the "people" database, particularly
  disambiguation; 
* development of a distributed architecture with the concept of nodes;
* enhance the ontologies and adjustments to the data.  But perhaps more
  importantly, 
* it provides a high-level view of the the issues facing the development
  of useful semantic infrastructure for collections of mathematical knowledge, 
* in particular: the challenges of sustainability and funding; and the need
  to focus on social processes at least as much as technical ones.

In fact, that latter is perhaps the mody important topic presented here.  The
paper is a very interesting high-level view of organizing and serving semantic
metadata in a social network context.  It contrasts "web of data" approaches to
social ones of community driven development of ontologies; emphasizes the role
of social processes as necessary to generate and apply useful semantic
annotation.

These social vs. data issues may be unfamiliar to many; the paper could perhaps
broaden its impact, with a few more concrete examples of the distinctions.

I enjoyed the paper, and recommend it for acceptance.

----------- Review -----------
The paper aims to describe reorganization of SymbolicData store to incorporate
new vision of how information should be acquired and stored.

I personally find that all the conceptual and architectural changes are
summarized in the last two sections and the rest of the paper rephrases
previously-seen works, lengthening the paper unnecessary.

In the section 6, discussing storing "information about scientific activities
of people mainly extracted from conference announcements", it could be nice to
get an idea on how this information is collected: is there a script/crawler
extracting such announcements from web/mail content or these data are populated
manually?

OVERALL EVALUATION: -1 (weak reject)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)

----------- Review -----------
The paper discusses redesigning issues of the SymbolicData project and
overviews some of the similar projects in the area.

As such, the paper has no scientific contributions, it mainly overviews past
and recent results, the state-of-the-at of in math representation. The issues
discussed in the paper try to motivate why a new design of the SymbolicData
project was needed at all - these issues include settings on github and
structuring data on the repository.

I found it hard to stay motivated while reading the paper. Sections 2-4
overview the history and related methods in math representation, and the rest
of the paper gives details on how various directories of SymbolicData are
organized. I wonder why these details would be interesting for others than the
maintainers of SymbolicData.

----------- Review -----------
The paper describes - amongst other things - the enlargement of the
SYMBOLICDATA database and adapts the CASN data to be Semantic Web compatible.

The paper seems a bit confused.  It leaps in very quickly with very little
explanation about the symbolicdata database - what it is for, how it is
organised, etc.  Parts of it read like a manual - e.g., a line ‘so please
adjust your local repo structure’.

There is then a section on the semantic web which makes some strong assertions
that I don’t believe in all cases are justified (see below for more detail).
There is then some political discussion about the pressures of funding and
quite a lot of detail about EU calls which seems excessive in a paper.
Finally, sections 5 and 6 get to the work done in this paper.

Perhaps one of the reasons it is a bit confusing is that there is no conclusion
or discussion at the end to tie all the parts together, nor any clear
explanation of the structure of the paper in the introduction.  There is also
no discussion of systems that do similar work in other domains, from which
surely useful lessons could be learned.  Without that, it has the feeling of
reinventing the wheel a bit.

Detailed comments:

It's very strong to say no interesting unintentional data. I don't agree that
formats, etc., have to be agreed beforehand *by the participants* - just that
standards need to be (at least vaguely) adhered to - this allows spontaneous
interaction (thought this can be difficult).

First sentence in sec 4 confused. 

Details of EU calls too specific for paper - what po/[int is being made here?
Don't agree with summary of this being orthogonal to the Semantic Web - some of
these topics could cover SW activity.

Are these quotes from individual reviewers? It is hard to extrapolate from that
- the statements that you make about why the project was funded are strong and
I'm not convinced supported by the evidence.

STEM is an abbreviation not a shortcut. 

On p.8, a figure from another paper is discussed.  If you want to refer in
detail to a figure, you should reproduce it.

What is this 'global data structure' that is referred to?

End of sec 5 - 'practical use of data from a special field requires a minimum
of semantic-awareness of the user itself' - ionly if the data only ever stays
within this field. But if you want it to be reusable in different domains, it's
a big deal.

Some of the points described in the CASN integration section sounds pretty
standard - is this innovative?  Is the application of this to this domain
innovative?  If so, how?

Some of it is mentioned as not up to date - what are the steps that are being
taken to keep the info fresh? This is crucial in the design.

*******
Overall, the paper describes work that seems useful but functional. It may be
more innovative than it appears but this is not conveyed well.  The paper could
do with more overview and discussion so that the structure is clearer.

General: Let me emphasize several points special to my contribution: 

1) SD grew up in 1998 in a situation where heavily founded projects finished
and people formerly not involved with the projects took efforts to secure part
of the research infrastructure developed during the project.  It was, is and
remains (intentionally) a volunteer's project without funding and lives on the
resources that these (changing over the time) volunteers are able to sideline
for SD.

2) My contribution is not a research paper but a paper about research
infrastructure. 

3) CICM-16 "especially solicits for papers on long standing projects".  

To Review 2-4: Let me first response to the criticism about the "unstructured
character" of the paper:

The paper concentrates on explanation of the conceptual background of the SD
redesign towards a CASN (sect. 2-5), the practical application of these
concepts to SD redesign within the scope of available resources and the ongoing
practical dynamics of the target communities, and contains "envisioned results
that are valuable to shape future" - not research but - research
infrastructure.  Sect. 1 contains a very short survey of the history of SD and
reports on "significant new developments in our ongoing previously presented
project".  In a revised version I put that in a separate section, add more
references to previously published work on SD and compile a short introduction
as a guideline through the paper as proposed by reviewer 4.

The argumentative core in sect. 2-4 combines arguments about the interplay
between socio-technical (sect. 2-3), social and political (sect. 4)
architecture as an extract of my long standing experience in (social)
implementation of semantic technologies in different "real world" domains, and
map that experience to the CASN target (sect. 5). Sect. 6 describes the
moments of implementation of this conceptual framework during the last two
years by the SD volunteers.

Some detailed remarks: 

Q: How information about conference announcements is collected? 

A: This data is populated neither "manually" nor "crawled" but tool-based to
ensure quality of the data. This is a classical data architect's approach.  

Q: Some of the points ... sounds pretty standard - is this innovative?

A: Yes, this is very innovative, since many semantic web projects don't use and
even don't recognize existing standards. Using standards reduces efforts and
thus enlarges the scope of work that could be done with given resources. 

Q: It's very strong to say no interesting unintentional data. I don't agree that
formats, etc., have to be agreed beforehand ...

A: The correct quote is "No interesting 'uninterpreted' data". There is a large
and controversial philosophical discussion about that topic that cannot be
addressed at that point. But I do not understand at all the reviewer's argument
on the background of the example given in the text (rendering a bit stream as
a picture).

Q: Are these quotes from individual reviewers?

A: As far as I see I added source information to all my citations, in
particular in sect. 4. Since I'm not involved with any of the projects in
sect. 4, I have no access to reviewer information about their project
proposals.

Q: What is this 'global data structure' that is referred to?

A: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web 

Q: 'practical use of data from a special field requires a minimum of
semantic-awareness of the user itself' -- ?

A: Example: To use Wreath Product decomposition information from Transitive
Groups http://symbolicdata.org/Data/TransitiveGroups/ you have to know what a
Wreath Product is.

Q: Some of it (the data) is mentioned as not up to date - what are the steps
that are being taken to keep the info fresh? This is crucial in the design.

A: In particular the book list
http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/symbolicdata/buchliste/ with rdf
source http://www.fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/rdf/Buchliste-Alt.rdf is not up
to date.  So it requires volunteers to update that information. The point is
that the German Fachgruppe launched an internal project about CA books several
years ago but did not manage to organize sustainably resources to collect such
information in a broad scope. The continuation of many undertakings depends on
the priorities of (changing) board members. But see
